# Demo project to demonstrate unit testing using xUnit

## Why is Unit testing

:heavy_check_mark: Help us to be Agile and eliminate fear of change  
:heavy_check_mark: Improve the code quality  
:heavy_check_mark: Help in debugging  
:heavy_check_mark: Help to find bugs in early stage of development  



## Comparision between nUnit and xUnit
:heavy_check_mark: xUnit have less attributes and attributes names are intutive  
:heavy_check_mark: xUnit follow principle of class and uses constructor for initialization/setup and IDispose for cleaup  
:heavy_check_mark: In xUnit its easy to inject Fixtures  
:heavy_check_mark: We can also use Moq in xUnit just like in nUnit
